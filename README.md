Step 8: You'll see several different default options to add or you can create your own. I'll be adding several different requests. I'll be creating few examples that I'll categorize for Accounts, Hardware, and Software.

Step 9: You can edit and view each request type by clicking on it. For this example, I'll use 'Create new user accounts'. You can add or remove fields as necessary and edit the text. 

For this request type, I'm going to make all the field "Required". Click on the '>' icon for each field and select 'Required'

Make sure you select 'Save changes' at the end before continuing anything else. 

At the bottom of the request field, you can 'select' view to see how the customer/user would see the request.

Step 10: After creating the request types, I'm going to create 3 group portals to organize the requests. On the left tab menu, click on 'Portal'

Step 14: Click on 'Accounts' portal and add the request types that fits in this category. After that, I'll put the other requests into the other two portals
